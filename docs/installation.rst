Installation and requirements
=============================

The only requirement is Python 2.7. Unfortunately Python 3 is not supported.

Currently, the easiest way of installing seqpoet is to clone the GitHub
repository and install it manually::

    > git clone https://github.com/maehler/seqpoet.git
    > cd seqpoet
    > python setup.py install

Eventually the package will be submitted to
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.
