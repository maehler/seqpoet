Installation and requirements
=============================

.. highlight:: bash

The only requirement is Python 2.7. Unfortunately Python 3 is not supported.

Currently, the easiest way of installing seqpoet is to download the `latest
release from GitHub <https://github.com/maehler/seqpoet/releases/latest>`_
and install it manually::

    > unzip seqpoet-0.3.1.zip # or tar zxvf seqpoet-0.3.1.tar.gz
    > cd seqpoet-0.3.1
    > python setup.py install

If you want the cutting edge version (potentially unstable), you can clone
the GitHub repository and install the package from the develop branch.

Eventually the package will be submitted to
`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.
