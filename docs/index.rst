propex: Prokaryotic Operon Extractor
====================================

The main purpose of propex is to provide a simple interface for `in silico`
PCR and operon extraction in prokaryotes. The secondary purpose of propex is
to be a Python package that can be used for handling sequence data in the form
of FASTA and GenBank files.
