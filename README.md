# propex

The main purpose of propex is to provide a simple interface for in silico PCR

## Requirements

Currently, the only requirement is Python >= 2.7.

## Installation

Currently, the easiest way to install propex is by downloading the source
files (or clone the repository) and (in the console) run

    python setup.py install

This should make the propex script available system wide, and you can test
this by running

    propex --version
